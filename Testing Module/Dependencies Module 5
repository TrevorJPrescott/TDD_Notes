- Dependency: a relationship between two components where the functionality of one component reliles on another component.

	eg: CsvRepo --> AnalysisService --> Report

	we want test isolation!

	we want to test just one thing
	We have coupled archetecture

Dependency Injection:
	- instead of each class moving up, it has a constructor parameter which will take in from 

	Framework/Configuration separation from Business Logic



Test Doubles:

- a crash dummy:

- Fake
	- Working Implementation, but is much simpler than a real one.
- Stub
	-a Ready-made answer to method calls
- Mock
	- Take the interactions with the objects

	mockito

	Spring for complicated programs

	Guise is also for complicated programs
